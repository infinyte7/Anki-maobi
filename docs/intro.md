# Introduction

### Anki

Anki is a program which makes remembering things easy. Because it's a lot more efficient than traditional study methods, you can either greatly decrease your time spent studying, or greatly increase the amount you learn.

There are two simple concepts behind Anki: **active recall testing** and **spaced repetition**. They are not known to most learners, despite having been written about in the scientific literature for many years. Understanding how they work will make you a more effective learner.
